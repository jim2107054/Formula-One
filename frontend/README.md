# Frontend

Next.js frontend for the AI-powered supplementary learning platform.

## Purpose

Student-centric web UI featuring:
- AI chat interface
- CMS browsing & content viewing
- Phase-2 community features (groups, shared resources)

## Setup

See root README.md for setup instructions.

## Architecture

This frontend communicates ONLY with the backend service. It never calls AI services directly.
